    <h3>This is just a refresher after a long while off</h3>
    <h4>Anchor Tags</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>They pretty much give you the links to other things</li>
            <li>Structured like "href" and a bunch of other details.</li>
            <li> It takes an atttribute.</li>
            <li>The attribute is href</li>
            <li> looks as follows <br>
                <!-- "<a href="effesso.com">Random bit of text that needs to be a link at the moment</a>" -->
            </li>
            <li>You gotta explicitly link the links in ussing the http protocol and "www" especially if your porject is online.</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Image Files</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image tags sorta work like href tags in that they actually take an attribute. </li>
            <li>Image tags take up the attribute "src" which is a link to the image sources</li>
            <li>There are attributes known as alts as well that make your site more accessible</li>
            <li>Since screen readers aren't that great at knowing what images are, alts hlp the blind see your images</li>
            <li>Alts are denoted as such: <br>
                <!-- '<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">' --><br> 
            </li>
            <li>As you'll notice, img tags have no closing tags. They just be rolling and vibing in the free world</li>
            <li>note how attributes just be in quotation marks</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Comments</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This might be unnecessary seeing as some paarts of this html doc are already comments but <br>
            to make a comment use the following syntax: <!--This is filler comment text--> </li>
            <li>The vscode shortcut is "ctrl+k+u" or "ctrl+/"  </li>
        </ul>
