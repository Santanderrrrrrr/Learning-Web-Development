    <h1>Refresher 2</h1>
    <h3>divs and spans</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>First remember block elements and inline elements</li>
            <li>Spans and divs are containers</li>
            <li>divs are block level content division elements</li>
            <li>Spans are also generic containers but are inline</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>reandom elements</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>there's the "hr" tag which has no closing tag and just creates a horizontal line</li>
            <li>there is also the "br" tag which also has no clocing tag and results in a break between lines</li>
            <li>there is the "sup" tag which elevates elements from the baseline like powers of numbers and </li>
            <li>then there's the "sub" tag that drops them under like in logariths</li>
            <li>sup and sub have closing tags and you wrap elements in them</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Semantic elements</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are certain things known as "semantic elements" that can be used instead of divs: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>section</li>
                <li>article</li>
                <li>nav</li>
                <li>main</li>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>footer</li>
                <li>aside</li>
                <li>summary</li>
                <li>details</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>These make your code a little bit more elegant</li>
            <li>Main is the dominant content of the body of a page and <br>
            excludes content that could be repeated across the body of a page</li>
            <li>Nav represents anything on the page that provides navigation</li>
            <li>A sction is a standalone segment that doesn't have a more specific semantic element</li>
            <li>the article element contains a composition in a document</li>
            <li>aside is tangential and not essential: think callout boxes, side bars</li>
            <li>header is introductory and may include the nav while the footer usually just has navs</li>
            <li>neither of these definitions are definitive. <br>
            all of these elements are pretty flexible. The labelling is just to make cooperation <br>
            easy</li>
            <li>finally there's the time element which is used to encapsulate <br>
            time and format it in a manner the machine could read and not necessarily just string</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Emmet</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>An extension that makes html mark-up typying easy</li>
            <li>comes bundled in with vscode</li>
            <li>There's an emmet documentation cheat sheet</li>
            <li>For example for a paragraph with an unordered list of list items, you could just type the following <br>
                <!-- p>ul>li --> and hit tab. like just look: <br>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>It may not be evident but the above is a list item in an unordered list in a paragraph drawn from emmet.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
